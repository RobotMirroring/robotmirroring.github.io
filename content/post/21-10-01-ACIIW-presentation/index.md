Our paper on Robot mirroring: Improving well-being by fostering empathy with an artificial agent representing the self was presented at ACII2021.

<!--more-->

We searched the literature to find supporting or opposing evidence for the robot mirroring framework. The results showed an increasing interest in self-tracking technologies for well-being management. Current discussions disseminate what can be achieved with different levels of automation; the type and relevance of feedback; and the role that artificial agents, such as chatbots and robots, might play to support people's therapies. These findings support further development of the robot mirroring framework to improve medical, hedonic, and eudaemonic well-being.
